# Minimalist Weather App

Another fully functional weather app, with a more sleek, simplified, and minimalist design. I chose to build this project for additional practice and to showcase a different style. This project was built as a SheCodes student using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. (I'm currently rebuilding with React.)
## Features

- Minimalist design
- Displays accurate weather data including temperature, weather description, and high and low temperatures
- Current location button that uses Geolocation API
- Background & color palette changes depending on the weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)



## Lessons Learned

This project was a fun project. It started just after I had finished my original weather app. My fiance saw the weather widget on our Smart TV and said, "Oh, that's a cool design for a Weather App. Can you do something like that?" I looked at it and said, "I can try! It'll be good practice!" One late night later, it was done! I had replicated the design. The next morning, I showed my fiance and he was like, "Oh snap! That was fast! You did that last night?" 

- In building this project, I learned that I could create something useful and polished within a few hours. 
- I also learned that I am capable of replicating designs, and that it starts with inspecting first, identifying what is needed and where (h1 here, div there) and then crafting a plan on how I was going to convert that design into code. 
- I also learned that that the tech and skills needed to build these apps wasn't at all as difficult and intimidating as I had previously thought. I could do this and in fact, did-- twice.    
## Optimizations

Refactors, performance improvements, responsive and mobile-friendly
